   It's not easy being green.<br>
   It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things.<br>
   And people tend to pass you over<br>
   'cause you're not standing out like flashy sparkles in the water<br>
   or stars in the sky.
</p>

<p id="beauty">
   But green's the color of Spring.<br>
   And green can be cool and friendly-like.<br>
   And green can be big like a mountain,<br>
   or important like a river,<br>
   or tall like a tree.
